Welcome to Nysa, a lending and borrowing platform designed to combine the reliability of Aave V3 with a next-generation, agent-driven management layer.\
The protocol builds on Aave V3’s proven architecture and integrates autonomous Agents (Gluo, Lumia, Vexo) with the high-performance Linea blockchain to provide a lending environment focused on transparency, consistency and AI-Driven suggestions.

### How can I use Nysa?

Nysa is an overcollateralized lending and borrowing protocol built on a secure and modern architecture built on top of Aave V3. Within Nysa, users can operate in the following roles:

* **Suppliers**\
  Users can deposit supported assets into the protocol and earn passive interest. Interest rates are variable and defined by the protocol’s interest rate model, which reflects real-time supply and demand conditions. Supplied assets are borrowed by other users and are fully secured by the collateral they deposit, ensuring protection against borrower insolvency.
* **Borrowers**\
  By depositing assets as collateral, users become eligible to borrow other tokens available on Nysa. Borrowing can serve multiple purposes, including taking long or short positions, executing market strategies, exploiting arbitrage opportunities, or accessing short-term liquidity without unwinding long-term holdings.
* **Liquidators**\
  When a position becomes under-collateralized, Nysa activates its liquidation mechanism. Liquidators can repay part of a borrower’s debt and receive a reward defined by the protocol. This process ensures system stability and protects supplier funds.

In addition, **any strategy, technical insight, or resource available within the protocol can be accessed and executed through Nysa’s AI Agents and their conversational interfaces**, enabling a more dynamic and guided interaction with the system.

# Supply & Withdraw

### Supply

In the Nysa lending protocol, the supply function allows users to deposit supported assets into the platform, contributing liquidity that can be borrowed by other participants. By supplying assets, users earn passive interest over time, determined by the protocol’s interest rate model and the supply-demand dynamics of each asset.

### Withdraw

The withdraw function enables users to retrieve the assets they previously supplied to the protocol, subject to available on-chain liquidity. When withdrawing, users also collect (“harvest”) the interest accrued over time from lending their assets.

### Tutorials

#### **How to Deposit (Supply)**

1. Access the Nysa App
2. In the **Market** table, locate the asset you want to deposit
3. Click **Supply**
4. Enter the amount you wish to deposit
5. Confirm and execute the transaction

***

#### **How to Withdraw**

1. Access the Nysa App
2. In the **Market** table, locate the asset you want to withdraw
3. Click **Withdraw**
4. Enter the amount you wish to withdraw
5. Confirm and execute the transaction

# Borrow & Repay

### Borrow

Once assets are supplied, they begin generating interest and simultaneously act as collateral, making the user eligible to borrow additional assets.\
The maximum borrowable amount is determined by each asset’s **Loan-To-Value (LTV)** parameter, which defines the proportion of an asset’s value that can be borrowed against its collateral.

> For example, if an asset has an LTV of 80% and the value of the supplied collateral is $10,000 at the time of the borrowing request, the user can borrow up to $8,000.\
> Borrowing allows users to take leveraged positions, access liquidity, or execute market strategies without liquidating their underlying holdings.\
> Further details are available in the *Borrowing* section of the documentation.

### Repay

The repay function enables borrowers to return the assets they previously borrowed, including any accrued interest.\
Repaying reduces the outstanding debt, restores the position’s health factor, and gradually releases the locked collateral. Once the debt is fully repaid, the collateral becomes entirely available for withdrawal or for opening new borrowing positions.

# Interest Rate Model

### **Introduction**

The Interest Rate Model defines how borrowing and supplying rates evolve based on the utilization of each reserve. Its objective is to maintain a healthy balance between available liquidity and borrowing demand. By adjusting interest rates dynamically according to market conditions, the model ensures efficient capital usage and preserves protocol stability.

Nysa adopts an interest rate strategy inspired by Aave V3’s proven framework, which uses a piecewise, two-slope curve. This model adjusts rates based on each reserve’s utilization, encouraging borrowing when liquidity is abundant and protecting liquidity when demand becomes high.

***

### **Utilization Rate**

The **Utilization Rate (U)** represents the proportion of a reserve currently borrowed.

$$
U = \frac{\text{Total Borrows}}{\text{Total Liquidity}}
$$

Where **Total Liquidity** is the sum of available liquidity and total borrowed assets.

* Low utilization → borrowing rates decrease
* High utilization → borrowing rates increase

***

### **Optimal Utilization Rate**

Each asset has a defined **Optimal Utilization Rate (U\_optimal)**.

* Below this point, interest rates increase gradually
* Above this point, interest rates rise more aggressively

This ensures the protocol remains efficient under normal usage and protected during periods of high borrowing activity.

***

### **Borrow Interest Rate Calculation**

The borrow rate is calculated using a **two-slope (kinked) model** consisting of:

* **Base Rate**
* **Slope 1** (applied before optimal utilization)
* **Slope 2** (applied after optimal utilization)

#### **Formulas**

If U ≤ U\_optimal:

$$
\text{BorrowRate} = \text{BaseRate} + U \cdot \text{Slope1}
$$

If U > U\_optimal:

$$
\text{BorrowRate} =
\text{BaseRate}

* \text{Slope1}
* \left(
  \frac{U - U\_{\text{optimal}}}{1 - U\_{\text{optimal}}}
  \right)
  \cdot \text{Slope2}
  $$

***

### **Supply Interest Rate Calculation**

Suppliers earn interest based on the borrow rate and the reserve’s utilization.

The supply rate is derived from:

* The **Borrow Rate**
* The **Utilization Rate (U)**
* The **Reserve Factor**, which specifies the portion of interest retained by the protocol

$$
\text{SupplyRate}
\= \text{BorrowRate} \cdot U \cdot (1 - \text{ReserveFactor})
$$

***

### **Key Parameters**

Each reserve defines the following parameters shaping the interest rate curve:

* **Base Rate**
* **Optimal Utilization Rate**
* **Slope 1**
* **Slope 2**
* **Reserve Factor**

These parameters must be calibrated to ensure the right balance between liquidity, efficiency, and system stability.

# Agents

Nysa introduces **NysaAgents**, a new suite of AI agents launched for the first time exclusively within the protocol. Their purpose is to simplify how users interact with DeFi systems and to extend Nysa’s functionality beyond traditional interfaces. The NysaAgents are designed with three core objectives:

* **Improve user experience** by providing conversational access to educational content, protocol updates, the Risk Framework, strategies, and core features of Nysa.
* **Reduce the knowledge and language barriers** typically present in DeFi, enabling safer and more informed participation in mainstream environments, regardless of the user’s native language.
* **Promote the adoption of AI Agents** across third-party protocols and the broader ecosystem, increasing the revenues of Nysa Protocol and its Sellers.

To achieve this vision, Nysa introduces **three specialized Agents**, available on Nysa:

* **Gluo** - Agent for Community Managent
* **Lumia** - Agent for Risk-Management
* **Vexo** - Agent for Conversational Access to DeFi Protocols
