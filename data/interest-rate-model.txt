# Interest Rate Model

### **Introduction**

The Interest Rate Model defines how borrowing and supplying rates evolve based on the utilization of each reserve. Its objective is to maintain a healthy balance between available liquidity and borrowing demand. By adjusting interest rates dynamically according to market conditions, the model ensures efficient capital usage and preserves protocol stability.

Nysa adopts an interest rate strategy inspired by Aave V3’s proven framework, which uses a piecewise, two-slope curve. This model adjusts rates based on each reserve’s utilization, encouraging borrowing when liquidity is abundant and protecting liquidity when demand becomes high.

### **Utilization Rate**

The **Utilization Rate (U)** represents the proportion of a reserve currently borrowed.

$$
U = \frac{\text{Total Borrows}}{\text{Total Liquidity}}
$$

Where **Total Liquidity** is the sum of available liquidity and total borrowed assets.

* Low utilization → borrowing rates decrease
* High utilization → borrowing rates increase

***

### **Optimal Utilization Rate**

Each asset has a defined **Optimal Utilization Rate (U\_optimal)**.

* Below this point, interest rates increase gradually
* Above this point, interest rates rise more aggressively

This ensures the protocol remains efficient under normal usage and protected during periods of high borrowing activity.

### **Borrow Interest Rate Calculation**

The borrow rate is calculated using a **two-slope (kinked) model** consisting of:

* **Base Rate**
* **Slope 1** (applied before optimal utilization)
* **Slope 2** (applied after optimal utilization)

#### **Formulas**

If U ≤ U\_optimal:

$$
\text{BorrowRate} = \text{BaseRate} + U \cdot \text{Slope1}
$$

If U > U\_optimal:

$$
\text{BorrowRate} =
\text{BaseRate}

* \text{Slope1}
* \left(
  \frac{U - U\_{\text{optimal}}}{1 - U\_{\text{optimal}}}
  \right)
  \cdot \text{Slope2}
  $$

### **Supply Interest Rate Calculation**

Suppliers earn interest based on the borrow rate and the reserve’s utilization.

The supply rate is derived from:

* The **Borrow Rate**
* The **Utilization Rate (U)**
* The **Reserve Factor**, which specifies the portion of interest retained by the protocol

$$
\text{SupplyRate}
\= \text{BorrowRate} \cdot U \cdot (1 - \text{ReserveFactor})
$$

***

### **Key Parameters**

Each reserve defines the following parameters shaping the interest rate curve:

* **Base Rate**
* **Optimal Utilization Rate**
* **Slope 1**
* **Slope 2**
* **Reserve Factor**

These parameters must be calibrated to ensure the right balance between liquidity, efficiency, and system stability.
