**Lumia** is dedicated to managing and simplifying the protocol’s **Risk Framework**.\
It suggests optimal borrowing amounts for users, monitors TVL, Value-at-Risk, Liquidation conditions, and Supply/Borrow Caps. Lumia can be connected to the DAO or communication channels to recommend updated Caps, VaR thresholds, and other risk-related parameters.\
Users may also consult Lumia for simplified explanations of their own risk posture and the protocol’s safety mechanics.
