# Supply & Withdraw

### Supply

In the Nysa lending protocol, the supply function allows users to deposit supported assets into the platform, contributing liquidity that can be borrowed by other participants. By supplying assets, users earn passive interest over time, determined by the protocol’s interest rate model and the supply-demand dynamics of each asset.

### Withdraw

The withdraw function enables users to retrieve the assets they previously supplied to the protocol, subject to available on-chain liquidity. When withdrawing, users also collect (“harvest”) the interest accrued over time from lending their assets.
